# Working with text files in R: exercises

This folder contains files that can be used for exploring R's functionality for handling text.

There is a [free ebook about Handling and Processing Strings in R here](http://gastonsanchez.com/Handling_and_Processing_Strings_in_R.pdf) (PDF).

[An introduction to data cleaning with R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf) also contains a section on character manipulation and "string normalisation".

Another free resource outlines [Basic Text Mining in R here](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/31867_8236987cf0a8444e962ccd2aec46d9c3.html)

[Hands-On Data Science with R Text Mining](http://onepager.togaware.com/TextMiningO.pdf) is another useful resource, as is [Introduction to Text Ming Package (TM)](https://angerhang.github.io/statsWithR/tutorials/textMiningIntro.html)

I keep text-related resources for R in my Pinboard bookmarks at [https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:text+r](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:text+r)
