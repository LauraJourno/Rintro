This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook documenting playing with the [swirl package](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) for learning R.

Swirl doesn't come pre-installed in RStudio, so we need to install it first

```{r}
install.packages("swirl")
```

Now to activate it:

```{r}
library("swirl")
```
Let's do what it says...

```{r}
swirl()
```

Note that this generates a response in the Console, but not within the Notebook itself. So you'll need to switch to that...
