# 10 things more than the other 10 things

# Sorting in R

It's quite common to need to sort a dataset in order to see which areas, people or organisations are doing worst or best. 

* R-Bloggers have written a tutorial on [Sorting a data frame by the contents of a column](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-sorting-a-data-frame-by-the-contents-of-a-column/)
* The process is [explained more simply here](http://www.statmethods.net/management/sorting.html)

You can [see an example of this in practice (and work on a real dataset) here](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rough-sleeping/blob/master/roughsleeping.Rmd)

# Working with SPSS and Stata files

I've [written a project here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/stata_spss/stata-spss-election-survey.Rmd) which shows how to grab election survey data in either Stata or SPSS formats and export as CSV.
