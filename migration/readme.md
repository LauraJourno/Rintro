# Migration data for using in R

This folder contains some very large data files which are useful for demonstrating some of the functionality in R (dealing with large files etc)

You can [find the data (on internal migration) on the ONS here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/migrationwithintheuk/datasets/internalmigrationbyoriginanddestinationlocalauthoritiessexandsingleyearofagedetailedestimatesdataset).

The data is so large that it's split into two parts. There is also a PDF with guidance, which in turn links to [the methodology on migration statistics here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/methodologies/internalmigrationmethodology).
