Once you have downloaded the election survey you can do some analysis or cleaning. Let's get an overview:

```{r}
head(electionsurvey15)
```

There are *lots* of columns, so aside from seeing the first few lines, we might just need to see what the column names are...

```{r}
colnames(electionsurvey15)
```


And let's get a quick pivot table of one particular column: why did people vote for a particular party?

```{r}
table(electionsurvey15$reasonForVote)
```

What about the EU referendum?

```{r}
summary(electionsurvey15$euRefVote)
```

And the general election?

```{r}
summary(electionsurvey15$generalElectionVote)
```

We can put those in a new table that might be more easily examined in Excel:

```{r}

```
