# R

R is a programming language used by *some* practitioners of data journalism, typically for data analysis and sometimes for visualisation. It isn't the only programming language used in this way: Python or JavaScript can both perform similar tasks, and then there's SQL, Ruby, PHP and plain old Excel. But no one expects you to know them all.

Python, JavaScript and R all have their strengths and weaknesses. And if you already know one or both of those you should be able to understand R relatively quickly (although there's [a useful explanation of R's quirks for programmers here](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/r_language_for_programmers/)).

This repo contains a bunch of guides and resources to help get started with R, or tackle particular problems. It includes:

* [10 things to do first in R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/10thingstodofirst.md) explains some key processes to get started with R. By the end you should be able to import data, analyse it, and save it as a new file on your computer.
* [10 things to do next in R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/10morethings.md) introduces **packages** in R: libraries of commands for particular problems. It also covers combining datasets, and importing and cleaning sheets from Excel workbooks.
* After that you might want to get your head around how R works more generally. [This page explains different types of 'objects' in R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/Robjects.md), from vectors (a type of list) and data frames (tables) to R's names for strings of characters, numbers and TRUE/FALSE values.
* Once you're working on projects and need to think about collaboration, saving code and other aspects of project management, [read this page on R project files, R scripts, and notebooks in R markdown](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/rprojects.md)

In addition there are lots and lots of resources to help you get to grips with R. If you want a general tutorial on using R, try some of the following:

* [This YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk6E57H6mTs&list=PLzDvAaXgHPFG_Y61OGHhDZpvhf8Z-jyW7&index=1) is based on a Coursera course on R. It has 12 videos that cover what R is used for, installing it, data types and some functions.
* [This YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJDrYUqNrHg&index=1&list=PLvhG5FRoq78otMp0WbWuJsFOarEAchMek) goes into more detail with 24 lessons covering installation and data types through to functions, packages and visualisation.
* There's a [list of free e-books on R on r-dir here](https://r-dir.com/learn/e-books.html).
* I maintain [bookmarks of MOOCs (online courses) about R here](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:r+mooc). It's worth searching for others on sites like Coursera.
* **.Rddj** is a list of [resources specifically for data journalism with R](http://rddj.info/)
* This [video outlines how data journalism outfit FiveThirtyEight use R](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/07/data-journalism-with-r-at-538.html)
* The New York Times' [**Amanda Cox** talks about how they use R in this excellent Data Stories podcast](http://datastori.es/ds-56-amanda-cox-nyt/)

Once you understand the basics, however, remember that the best way to learn R is to pick a project, work out what you'll need to do to complete it - and then search online for those techniques in R. Sites like [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) have lots of posts explaining different techniques to solve different problems.

In a [presentation](https://andypryke.github.io/DataJournalismShortTalk/#1) at [Hacks/Hackers Birmingham](https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Birmingham/events/233683857/), **Andy Pryke** also gave these tips:
