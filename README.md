# 10 things to do with R first

R is a programming language used by *some* practitioners of data journalism, typically for data analysis and sometimes for visualisation. It isn't the only programming language used in this way: Python or JavaScript can both perform similar tasks, and then there's SQL, Ruby, PHP and plain old Excel. But no one expects you to know them all.

Python, JavaScript and R all have their strengths and weaknesses. And if you already know one or both of those you should be able to understand R relatively quickly (although there's [a useful explanation of R's quirks for programmers here](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/r_language_for_programmers/)).

* [10 things to do first in R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/10thingstodofirst.md) explains some key processes to get started with R. By the end you should be able to import data, analyse it, and save it as a new file on your computer.
* [10 things to do next in R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/10morethings.md) introduces **packages** in R: libraries of commands for particular problems. It also covers combining datasets, and importing and cleaning sheets from Excel workbooks.
* After that you might want to get your head around how R works more generally. [This page explains different types of 'objects' in R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/Robjects.md), from vectors (a type of list) and data frames (tables) to R's names for strings of characters, numbers and TRUE/FALSE values.
