# Functions and loops in R

Functions in R are stored in the same way as other objects are, with the `<-` assignment, with a structure like so:

`FUNCTIONNAME <- function(ARGUMENTS) { ACTIONS }`

If you've created functions in JavaScript you'll notice that it's a very similar structure. Here's a working example:

`add2numbers <- function(num1, num2) {`

`total <- num1 + num2 `

`return total`

`} `
