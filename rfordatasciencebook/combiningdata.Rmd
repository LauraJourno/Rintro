These are notes from the book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - specifically the [section on relational data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#relational-data).

Let's start by installing the tidyverse collection of packages, and activating it in our library.

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

And a few other packages that contain data we want to use:

```{r}
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))
```

## 3 types of joins

Hadley outlines "three families of verbs designed to work with relational data":

* **Mutating joins**, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another. 
* **Filtering joins**, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.
* **Set operations**, which treat observations as if they were set elements.

And two types of **key**:

* A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. For example, planes$tailnum is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each plane in the planes table.
* A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, the flights$tailnum is a foreign key because it appears in the flights table where it matches each flight to a unique plane.

You can use a **surrogate key** such as an index (row number) if the dataset has no key and values cannot be combined to create a unique one.

> "One way to [verify a primary key is unique] is to count() the primary keys and look for entries where n is greater than one:"

```{r}
#Bring in the library of data
library(nycflights13)
#Check the uniqueness of the tailnum field in the planes data
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) #The result is a tibble with 0 rows because there are no matches
```

## Combining tables using `left_join()`

We can use the SQL-like function `left_join()` to join two tables on a common value. Note that this generates two outputs: the joined table but also a message about how it has decided to join the two original tables (because we haven't told it):

```{r}
#The two tables here have been generated in the cleaningtidydata.Rmd notebook - run the code in that notebook first.
left_join(tidy4a,tidy4b)
```

## Using the SQL `select` command

Let's create a new dataset from the planes data using a pipe as the basis for a `select` command (think of the `%>%` as analagous to SQL's `FROM` command):

```{r}
flights2 <- flights %>%
  #the colon indicates the columns between the two named
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier) #select is a SQL command
flights2
```

Now we use `left_join` to convert those carrier codes into actual names. These are stored in another dataset, *airlines*, and we specify the column they have in common with `by = `

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin,-dest) %>% #two columns are removed first
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") #specify the common column to join on
```

### Doing the same with `mutate()`

Here's the code with `mutate()` instead. This time we specify the column from `airlines` we want to grab, and what column we are matching against in each. This can be useful if the columns don't have the same name in each dataset:

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  mutate(name = airlines$name[match(carrier, airlines$carrier)]) #grab the 'name' column from airlines, match the 'carrier' column from flights2, to the 'carrier' column in airlines
```
