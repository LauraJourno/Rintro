This script outlines how to grab CSV files for all leagues in England and combine them to get a master list

This data was [spotted at Football-Data.co.uk](http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php). The first thing to point out was that:

* The data is in CSV files
* The CSV files are regularly updated. By that I mean, the site doesn't add *more* files (which is common), but instead updates *one* file. That means the URL of the file will always be the same.


## Importing the data

```{r}
#Store each URL
url_prem <- 'http://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/1617/E0.csv'
url_cham <- 'http://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/1617/E1.csv'
url_lg1 <- 'http://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/1617/E2.csv'
url_lg2 <- 'http://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/1617/E3.csv'
#By now we notice that the URL pattern is consistent and we could have generated them, but for 4 URLs it's probably quicker to type

#Import CSVs from the web into variables
lg1 <- read.csv(url_lg1)
lg2 <- read.csv(url_lg2)
cham <- read.csv(url_cham)
prem <- read.csv(url_prem)

#Show the first few rows
head(lg1)
```
